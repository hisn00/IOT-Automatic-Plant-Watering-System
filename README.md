## 🌟 **How It Works**  
1. **Monitor Water Levels**:  
   - Ultrasonic sensor captures real-time water levels in the tank.  
   - Data is displayed dynamically on the GUI.  

2. **Automated Control**:  
   - Motor turns ON/OFF based on predefined water level thresholds.  
   - Manual control option included in the GUI.  

3. **IoT Connectivity**:  
   - Future-ready for integration with cloud platforms like Firebase or Blynk for remote monitoring.

## 🎉 **Planned Features**  
1. **Cloud Integration**:  
   - Real-time monitoring on mobile or desktop through IoT platforms.  
2. **Multi-Tank Support**:  
   - Manage multiple tanks simultaneously.  
3. **Voice Control**:  
   - Alexa/Google Assistant integration for motor control.
