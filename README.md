## 🛠️ **How It Works**  
**1. Monitor**:  
- Temperature readings from the DHT11 sensor are displayed in real-time.  
- Threshold-based motor control for temperature regulation.  

**2. Control**:  
- Use the GUI to manually turn the motor on/off.  

**3. Expand**:  
- Add new sensors and features easily using our modular design.

## 🌟 **UI Enhancements**  
🎨 **Improved GUI**: Now with better color schemes and labels.  
🌈 **Dynamic Icons**: Interactive icons enhance the interface.  
🖼️ **Custom Theme**: Makes the UI visually appealing.
