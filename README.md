Project Title:

IOT Automatic Plant Watering System

2. Description:

This project simulates an IoT-powered automatic plant watering system using Arduino and various sensors. The system monitors the moisture level of the soil and, when necessary, automatically waters the plants. The project uses sensors like a temperature sensor (DHT11 or TMP36) and integrates with a watering pump to simulate real-world IoT automation.

3. Components Used:

Arduino Uno

DHT11 or TMP36 temperature sensor

Relay Module (for controlling the watering system)

Water Pump (or DC Motor for simulation)

Jumper Wires

4. Project Objective:

Build a simple, automated irrigation system that uses temperature data from a sensor to control the watering of a plant.


5. How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Set up the Arduino circuit on Tinkercad.

Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino Uno.

Use the Tkinter GUI to monitor and control the watering system.


6. Installation Instructions:

For Arduino:

Install the Arduino IDE on your computer.

Set up the circuit on Tinkercad and upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board.

For Python:

Install Python and required libraries: Tkinter for GUI, PySerial for communication with Arduino.

Clone this repository and run the app.py file.
